Welcome to the AI-Powered Cooking Simulator!
In this text-based cooking game, you begin your journey as the owner of a small street-side food stand. Your goal? Work your way up to owning larger and better restaurants!
Each day starts at the Cooking Emporium—a massive store where you can buy all the ingredients and supplies you’ll need. After shopping, return to your food stand and start cooking.
You'll prepare four meals per day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. How well you cook each meal determines how much money you earn. Use your earnings to buy better ingredients, upgrade your equipment, and eventually move into bigger and more advanced cooking establishments.
You play by simply typing your actions. The AI reads what you write and responds based on the game’s built-in rules. Talk to it like you would a real person: ask questions, explain what you want to do, and describe how you're cooking. The more detailed and skillful your cooking descriptions are, the better your results will be!
Think you’ve got what it takes to be a top chef?
You will need to <a href="{{ url_for('register_page') }}"> Register a new account</a>
in order to keep track of your progress in the game. Next time you visit, you can click the Login link at the top to login with your account and pick up where you left off. Let’s get cooking!
